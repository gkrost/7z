/*
NewHandler.h (and historically NewHandler.cpp) handled very old toolchains
where operator new() did not throw on allocation failure.

This file must be included before any code that uses operators new() or delete().

DOCs:
  Since ISO C++98, operator new throws std::bad_alloc when memory allocation fails.
  MSVC 6.0 returned a null pointer on an allocation failure.
  Beginning in VS2002, operator new conforms to the standard and throws on failure.

  By default, the compiler also generates defensive null checks to prevent
  these older-style allocators from causing an immediate crash on failure.
  The /Zc:throwingNew option tells the compiler to leave out these null checks,
  on the assumption that all linked memory allocators conform to the standard.

Windows builds require Visual Studio 2017+, where operator new conforms to the
standard and throws std::bad_alloc on allocation failure.
